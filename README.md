Introduction
Linear regression is utilized in business, science, and just about any other field where predictions and forecasting are relevant. It helps identify the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Simple linear regression is defined by using a feature to predict an outcome.

Stock market forecasting is an attractive application of linear regression. Modern machine learning packages like scikit-learn make implementing these analyses possible in a few lines of code. Sounds like an easy way to make money, right?
